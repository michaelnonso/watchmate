JWT WEB TOKEN AUTHENTICATION
for javascript front end framworks
jwt.io

pip install djangorestframework_simplejwt

add to global main project setting if you want to add it globally


uasername,password----->AT(access token;5mins)   ---saved in local storage on client side
                        RT(refresh token;24hrs)

token is verified using a special algo and no need to maintain the
token value in database or do calls to database to verify it 
therefore load on database is reduced.

Refresh token is used to regenerate a new access token when the access token gets destroyed after 5mins

Token is nade up of header, payload and signature

we cant use jwt in browser, we can use it in postman or http pi in cmd

unlike in token (Token 50b53815f24d45235704a1bd47d89e46079923eb) 
in JWT we use (Bearer access_token) and this is sent by POST in header to 'api/token/'


After 5min the acces token is destroyed and new one is regenerated with the refresh Token however the refresh token itself stays the same

(refresh refresh_token as key value pair) is sent by POST in the body(x-wwww.form-urlencoded) to the refresh url;'api/token/refresh/'

SETTINGS CAN BE ADDED TO GENERATE A NEW REFRESH TOKEN  AFTER Refresh


added to project setting
SIMPLE_JWT = {
    'ROTATE_REFRESH_TOKENS': True
}


NOTE THAT BOTH REFRESH AND ACCESS TOKEN CARRIERS USER_ID THAT CONNECTS
THE USER TO THE TOKEN.


DISADVANTAGE OF JWT
acces cant be revoked as long as the refresh token and access token are still valid excet the user is deleted[***or a new token is generated for the user but not sent to him]
because the token is stored in the local storage on the front end side which we do not have access to

FOR LOGOUT.
front end can implement by deleating the tokens stored in the local storage
